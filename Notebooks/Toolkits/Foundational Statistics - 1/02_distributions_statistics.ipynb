        "Assume John owns a bakery where he sells bread, and he tracks his daily sales over several months. He discovers an average daily sale of 100 loaves with a standard deviation of 20 loaves. Assuming the bread sales follow a normal distribution (a sensible assumption given many random factors affecting the sales), we can utilize properties of the normal distribution to make future sales predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying the \"68, 95, 99.7\" rule (also known as the empirical or 3-sigma rule), we can state that:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Planning**: By understanding the distribution, John can enhance his inventory and operational planning. For instance, he could ensure he always has enough raw materials to bake at least 120 loaves each day, as this meets demand for 68% of the days.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Decision-Making**: If John considers increasing his production, he can examine the distribution and determine how often he might need extra capacity. For example, if contemplating expanding to make 160 loaves daily, he could observe that he'll only need this additional capacity on 0.3% of the days (as 99.7% of the time, sales will be lower).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Risk Estimation**: The normal distribution is also useful for anticipating risks. For instance, John could use it to calculate the probability that sales will drop below a certain point (say, 50 loaves per day) that could make his operation financially unviable.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the normal distribution is a highly valuable tool in statistics and data analysis and can assist in various aspects of business and decision-making."
